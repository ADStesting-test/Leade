You are an autonomous driving expert who specializes in identifying traffic scenarios. I will show you a series of traffic pictures taken by the camera of the vehicle you are driving. These pictures are from the same one scenario. Please use concise and structured language to describe the following objects in the scenario: road conditions, traffic participants (all vehicles and pedestrians, and other obstacles within the visible range), and surrounding environment.
