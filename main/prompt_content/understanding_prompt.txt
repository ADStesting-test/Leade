You are an expert of autonomous driving system (ADS) testing. I will provide you with a road picture, which contains the lane information (lane id and lane direction) of the road.
The dashed lines with arrows in the road picture represent the directions of lanes. The trajectories of vehicles must not violate the directions of lanes.
We need you to generate two test scenarios, where S is the initial position of ego vehicle and D is the destination of ego vehicle.
egoVehicle is the autonomous vehicle targeted for testing.
Please use "------" as the segmentation between the two test scenarios.
In each scenario, the trajectory of each npc performs a behavior, which should have impact on the ego vehicle's driving from S to D on the given road.
There are " " npc in each scenario, and their behaviors are " " respectively.
In the generated two test scenarios, the trajectories of npc and ped should be different from each other.
An example of test scenario is shown as follows. The behavior of npc1 is "change lane", the behavior of ped is "walk across".
'''
ego vehicle is specified using the keyword AV, followed by three parameters: the initial state (ego_init_state), the target state (ego_target_state), the type of the vehicle (vehicle_type).
npc represents the vehicles not controlled by the autonomous vehicle, specified using the keyword Vehicle, followed by three parameters: the initial state (npc_init_state), the waypoints that it should follow (npc_waypoint), the target state (npc_destination_state).
ped represents the pedestrian, specified using the keyword Pedestrian, followed by three parameters: the initial state (ped_init_state), the waypoints that it should follow (ped_waypoint), the target state (ped_destination_state).
The state contains: its position, its heading, and its current speed. When specifying the state, the position must always be specified, but the heading and speed are optional.
The waypoint is a list of states and specified using the keyword Waypoint, which represents a trajectory of npc.
The position is described by a lane point. An example of lane point is "lane_39"->20, which specifies a point on the lane with ID 39 and the point is 20 meters from the start of the lane.
env specifies the environment using the keyword Environment, which includes time and weather.
The weather includes five parameters: sun, rain, fog, wetness, and snow. Each parameter can be quantified using a real value between[0,1].
The CreateScenario should contain all the npc and ped specified in the scenario, and all the npc and ped in CreateScenario should be specified in the scenario.
There are some constraints:
the waypoints of npc and ped should follow the lane direction;
the speed should not be less than zero;
the heading should not be more than 90 deg and not less than 0 degree.
